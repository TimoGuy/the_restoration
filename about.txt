--About the Game--
Most games are skill-based. This is a game that is so,
however there is a twist: not only is the player tested
in this way, they are also tested in the scheme of a
couple of Christlike attributes. Namely: obedience (there
will be ppl in the game who tell the player to not do
something)

--Controls--
For this game, in order to play on keyboard (the standard
way that at least I'LL play this thing), because it's a
platformer, we will use:
-wasd for movement				// Will be a joystick in the virtual controller
-j for run or action			// Will be "Button1"
-k for action (prob. jump)		// Will be "Button2"
