# 'i' is the collision image (and obj init map)
# 's' is a sprite (first one is the tileset) (may animate if desired)
# 'm' is the tile-placement map (should correspond w/ the 'i' image)
# 'o' is an object (o\t<sprite id (-1 for nothing)>\tx,y,z(if >0 then will be considered a background, and its parallax will be determined by a value from 1 - 1000)
# 'c' is a prop set (really, it's a cutscene though)
